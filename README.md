# Building React Apps with TypeScript

> This is the sample application for the Building React Apps with TypeScript course, at Pluralsight.

Note that this course and examples assumes you have familiarity with React to begin with. The TypeScript concepts are introduced gradually. The goal is to provide a streamlined knowledge of the concepts needed to get up and running with TypeScript quickly.

## Installation

Run `yarn install-deps` or `npm run install-deps` at the root of the project and it will install all the dependencies.

## Running the app

Run `yarn start` at the root of the project.

The API is available at /api.

The example app used in the course is available at /app.

## Module Layout

For the first module about updating an application to use TypeScript, check out the `main` branch for a default implementation of the app written in javascript. You can use this project (or any javascrit project you have) to start with.

The second module covering class and function components is located from the `m3-class-and-function-components` branch to start, and the completed example is in the `m3-class-and-function-components-final` branch.

The last module follows the same pattern, with the initial starting point in the `m4-declaring-and-using-hooks-with-typescript` branch and the final code in the `m4-declaring-and-using-hooks-with-typescript-final` branch.
